# customer_segmentation

This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques. By analyzing behavioral data, the project aims to identify distinct customer groups to support personalized marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and optimize resource allocation.

I employ K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to group customers based on similarities in their spending and demographics. This segmentation helps businesses better understand their customer base and develop data-driven business decisions.
